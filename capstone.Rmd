## Project Overview

This project explores patterns in customer behavior to determine what influences repeat purchases in an e-commerce setting.

## Key Steps
- Cleaned the dataset: removed duplicates, standardized columns, and handled missing data
- Used R for exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed customer trends by purchase frequency, order size, delivery time, and product category

## Findings
Customers who had faster delivery and made higher-value purchases were more likely to return. Certain product types also showed higher repeat rates.
