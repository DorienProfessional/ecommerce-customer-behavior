# Share Step – Capstone Project Summary

To share my findings on what makes customers repeat buyers, I created clear, visually engaging charts using R’s ggplot2 package, focusing on key factors like product category and delivery time. I summarized results in an accessible, easy-to-navigate GitHub Pages website that includes downloadable datasets and a detailed README. My presentation emphasizes actionable insights, such as the importance of fast delivery in driving repeat purchases. Accessibility considerations like alt text for images and colorblind-friendly palettes were applied to ensure inclusivity.

## 1. Determine the Best Way to Share Your Findings

- GitHub Pages Website: Host project pages with findings and visualizations.
- PDF Report: Summarize analysis and recommendations.
- Presentation Slides: Prepare slides for live or recorded presentation.
- Interactive Dashboard: Use R Shiny or Tableau for exploration.

## 2. Create Effective Data Visualizations

- Use bar charts, boxplots, line charts, and pie charts.
- Keep visuals clear, with titles, labels, and legends.
- Example R code snippet:

```r
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data_summary, aes(x = category, fill = repeat_buyer)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Repeat Buyers by Product Category", x = "Product Category", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
